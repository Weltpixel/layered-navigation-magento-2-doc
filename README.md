  <h1>WHAT IS THE MAGENTO LAYERED NAVIGATION?</h1>
  <p>
Attribute Multi Select Ajax Filter is a tool for narrowing down the displayed product list within a category by specifying one or more product attributes (e.g., narrowing the 750 products in the “Clothing” category by size, color, material, cut, etc). Multiple filters can be combined by the user to meet some very specific needs (e.g., “color: black,” “price: $19.99 - $49.99,” “waist size: 32,” and “length size: 34”). Customers that use the filters are usually converting at a much higher rate as they are able to find exactly what they are looking for in a matter of seconds.

                               <h2>Ajax Filter with Filter Search Box. Color Swatch Ajax Filter.</h2>
                               <p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-layered-navigation/ajax-filtering.png"></p>
                                <p>
We implemented the Ajax Filter do decrease time between the moment when the customer clicks a filter and moment when the products are filtered. The Ajax Filter eliminates the need of a full page refresh so your customers can experience a much faster and smoother transition while applying each filter.
    </p>
    <p>
Not having an Ajax Filter Option would apply 2-4 seconds (even more based on your website page load time) every time a filter is applied or removed. In addition it would interfere with the pageview count metric in Google Analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
To enable this filter, simply go to <strong>WeltPixel -> Layered Navigation -> Enable Ajax ( Yes / No )</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Customize Ajax Filter and Color Swatch Attribute Multi Select.</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-layered-navigation/customize-each-filter.png"></p>
<p>
Magento does not allow by default to customize any attribute. With our extension now you can easily determine which filter is the most relevant so you can collapse the ones less used and allow focus on the most important ones.
    </p>
    <p>
This option can be found under:
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Manage Attributes -> Select the attribute that you would like to customize -> Filter Display Option: ( Fully Opened / Closed / Expandable )</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
If you are looking for a midway solution, you will also have the option to use the Show more functionality. This option allows you to display by default 5 options (the number of options is configurable) and then have a “show more” button to reveal more.
    </p>
    <p>
You will also be able to select if you would like to display Quantity and how the sorting should be setup.
    </p>
    <p>
This option can be found under:
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Manage Attributes -> Select the attribute that you would like to customize -> Show Item Counter: ( Yes / No )</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Manage Attributes -> Select the attribute that you would like to customize -> Sort by: ( Position / Name )</strong>
    </p>
     <h2>New Filter Options for Category Restriction. Improved Layered Navigation.</h2>
     <p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-layered-navigation/hide-blocks.png"></p>
     <p>
You probably already looked it up on Google how to remove the Category, Compare and Wishlist blocks. Look no further! You will now have the option to display or hide which block you want your customers to interact with.
    </p>
    <p>
This options can be found under:
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>WeltPixel -> Layered Navigation -> Show Category Filter: Yes/No</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>WeltPixel -> Layered Navigation -> Show Compare Products block: Yes/No</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>WeltPixel -> Layered Navigation -> Show Wish List block : Yes/No</strong>
    </p>
   <h2>Attribute Multi Select. Color Swatch Multi Select. Shop by Brand.</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-layered-navigation/multiselect.png"></p>
 <p>
The Attribute Multi Select feature is the most often used by your customers. Some attributes such as size swatch or color swatch is often multi selected. Eg. In a shoe category that contains multiple sizes, the customer might select the following sizes 8.5/9/9.5 to make sure that he finds what he needs as sizing might often vary based on brand or style.
    </p>
    <p>
This option can be found under:
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Manage Attributes -> Select the attribute that you would like to customize -> Enable Attribute Multi Select: Yes/No</strong>
    </p>
<h2>Price Slider. Filter Values Qty. Slide Down Horizontal Filtering.</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-layered-navigation/options-search-price-slider-rating-filtering.png"></p>
 <p>
Filter Search Box. Search trough multiple options with ease. Enable this functionality for any text attribute. Go to <strong>Stores -> Attributes -> Product -> [select desired attribute from grid] -> Storefront Properties -> WeltPixel Layered Navigation Properties</strong> section and enable <strong>Enable options filter</strong> on Desktop/Mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
Let your customers filter by price using a Price Slider. Go to <strong>Admin > WeltPixel > Layered Navigation > Sidebar Settings > Price Filter</strong> and select Slider design.
    </p>
    <p>
Product ratings can be incredibly helpful to users. Allow filtering products by ratings if your customers rely on ratings to gauge a product’s quality or value. Go to <strong>Admin > WeltPixel > Layered Navigation > Sidebar Settings > Enable Rating Filter</strong> and you can easily configure the ratings filter.
    </p>
    <p>
This option can be found under:
    </p>
    <p>
<strong>Manage Attributes -> Select the attribute that you would like to customize -> Enable Attribute Multi Select: Yes/No</strong>
    </p>
 <h2>Category restriction for attribute visibility. Item count visibility control.</h2>
 <p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-layered-navigation/Visibility-Demo.png"></p>
  <p>
Displaying or hiding a filtrable attribute from a category navigation with filter search box option becomes essential when optimizing the store so end users can find the product they are looking for. Oftentimes, some attributes might not be relevant to specific categories but they show up in Layered Navigation because of the products' configuration. Showing only relevant attributes will ease up the search process based on attribute filtering, leading to increased conversion. Filter Search Box is a must if you have multiple attributes under categories.
    </p>
    <p>
For example, in the above screencap, <strong>Leather</strong> is an option under the <strong>Material</strong> attribute. This shop's category (leather collection) contains only products that are made of leather, so the attribute becomes obsolete. By showcasing only the relevant attributes for this specific category, the end user will be able to easily find the exact product they are looking for.
    </p>
     <h2>SEO Improvements that drives results</h2>
      <p>
We often seen implementations where certain attributes are added to the URL and delimited by a simple “/”. That implementation can often be very dangerous as there is no easy way of eliminating all the attribute combinations which often result in generation of ten’s of thousands of unwanted url.
    </p>
    <p>
Over many years of experience with Enterprise Customers, and working with leading SEO agencies, we found the most scalable implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
We are keeping each attribute as a query in the URL: https://weltpixel.com/women/tops-women/jackets-women.html?color=56&size=167 the attribute parameter Color Swatch and Size Swatch can be easily removed using Robots.txt file, excluded in various sitemap generator tools as well as excluded in Google Search Console.
    </p>
    <p>
The URL canonical tag remains the original URL https://weltpixel.com/women/tops-women/jackets-women.html
    </p>
    <p>
The above implementation helped rank our Enterprise Customers on top 3 position for the highest competitive keywords in the industry.

    <ul>
<li>
            Displaying of hiding an attribute from a category becomes essential when optimizing the store for the best user experience. It often happens that the store might have a category that matches an attribute. A great example for that are categories specifically for Genders or Brands.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ex: Men’s category contains products that are for the Gender, Men. In that situation the attribute becomes obsolete.
            </li>
            <li>
                To have full control over which attribute displays in a category simply follow the next steps:
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Store -> Attributes -> Product</strong>
                    </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.weltpixel.com/media/wysiwyg/product-layered-navigation/Layered1.png"></p>
<ul>
 <li>
Select the desired <strong>attribute</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Go to <strong>Storefront Properties</strong> and find the following two options down the page
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Category Visibility</strong> (Select visibility behavior in categories for the current attribute.) “Visible in all categories” is the default Magento behavior “Visible only in the following categories” will allow you to select specific attributes that you only want to display in a few categories “Not visible in the following categories” will allow you to select the very few categories where you would not like to display the attributes. Note: Product attributes will only show in categories that contain products with specific attributes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Select Categories</strong> allows you to select as many or as little categories as you prefer. The selected categories will have the behavior from <strong>Category Visibility</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
